# ToDoSymfony

Welcome to the Symfony TodoList API project! This is my first venture into Symfony, and I'm excited to share this TodoList API with you.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a simple and efficient API for managing a TodoList. Whether you're building a task management application or just experimenting with Symfony, this API can serve as a solid foundation.

## Features
CRUD Operations: Perform all basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
Authentication: Secure endpoints with authentication to ensure data privacy.
Validation: Validate input data to maintain data integrity.
Documentation: Clear and concise documentation using Symfony annotations and tools.

## Technologies Used
Symfony: Symfony is a powerful PHP framework known for its flexibility and robustness.
Doctrine ORM: Doctrine provides an object-relational mapper for database interactions.
API Platform: API Platform is used for quickly building APIs with Symfony, providing tools for creating APIs in no time.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for securing endpoints and authenticating users.

## Getting Started
To get started with this TodoList API, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/symfony-todolist-api.git
Install dependencies: composer install
Set up the database: php bin/console doctrine:database:create && php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
